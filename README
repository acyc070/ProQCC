This is a modification to John Carmack's Quake-C compiler.  It allows for
decompiling to Quake-C native code, compiles over 3 times faster then the standard QCC.

Command line options:
         By default, ProQCC looks for progs.src in the current directory
           -dec [datfile]       : decompile progs.dat
           -src <directory>     : look in a different directory
           -copy <srcdir>       : build a clean data tree
           -pak <srcdir>        : build a clean pak file
           -bspmodels <gamedir> : bsp all bmodels
           -nolog               : does not write error.log if there are
                                  errors during compiling/decompiling

The decompiled code is usually generated correctly, but manual tweaking is sometimes necessary. 

The source code isn't the prettiest, but isn't bad considering I was 15 when I
wrote it.  It's awesome that there are still people using it.
